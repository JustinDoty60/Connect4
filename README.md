# Connect4
Connect 4 game created using java.net API from Java core library. Multiple clients can play on local network together!

**Extract Files**

4) If a GUI pops up telling you to enter your name, you are good to go!
5) For multiple clients(players), repeat these steps!!!

**How it works**
Players are first prompted to give their display name. Once they select a name, 
they will be brought into the lobby area where they can invite other non-busy 
players, player's that are not in a game currently, to play a game of Connect 4.
Invites can be declined and accepted and players have the option to rematch one
another after a game. I hope you enjoy! Thanks for playing.
